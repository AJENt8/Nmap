# üîé Nmap Lab

> **Summary:** Practiced host and NSE script discovery, port scanning, service and OS enumeration, and special scanning techniques such as the **Xmas scan**. Strengthened reconnaissance fundamentals essential for vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.

---

## üéØ Objective
Use Nmap to perform host discovery, service and OS enumeration, and advanced scanning techniques in order to identify and analyze networked systems in a controlled lab environment.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment
- Platform: TryHackMe ‚Äî *Nmap* room  
- Tool: **Nmap (Network Mapper)**  
- Focus Areas:  
  - Host discovery
  - Nmap switches
  - Port scanning (TCP, SYN, & stealth techniques)  
  - Service & version detection  
  - OS fingerprinting
  - ICMP Network Scanning
  - Advanced scans (Xmas scan)
  - NSE Scripts 
  - Output & reporting  

---

## üöÄ Workflow

### 1) Host Discovery
- Used ping sweep (`-sn`) to identify live hosts.  
- Applied techniques to bypass simple firewall restrictions.  
  ```bash
  nmap -sn 
  
### 2) Port Scanning
- Ran full TCP SYN scans (`-sS`) and TCP connect scans (`-sT`) to enumerate open ports.
- Tuned scan timing with `-T1` (stealthier) and `-T4` (faster).
  ```bash
  nmap -sS 
  nmap -sT 
  
## 3) Service & Version Detection
- Used service enumeration to identify application versions:
  ```bash
  nmap -sV 
- Example findings included older SSH and web server versions.

## 4) OS Fingerprinting & Aggressive Scans
- Used OS detection (`-O`) and aggressive scan (`-A`) to gather deeper host insights.
  ```bash
  nmap -O 
  nmap -A 

## 5) Advanced Scanning ‚Äî Xmas Scan
- Performed an Xmas scan to probe how the system responds to unusual flag combinations (FIN, PSH, URG).
  ```bash
  nmap -sX 
- Outcome: Showed closed vs. open/filtered port behavior, demonstrating how stealth scans can bypass certain firewall rules.
  
## 6) Output & Reporting
- Practiced saving scan results in multiple formats for reporting:
  ```bash
  nmap -oN nmap-results.txt
  nmap -oX nmap-results.xml 

## 7) Utilizing and Activating Scripts
- Practiced searching for installed scripts and categories of scripts:
  ```bash
  /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db
  ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*ftp*
  grep "safe" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db
- New scripts can also be created using the `sudo wget` command
- Practiced activating NSE scripts:
  ```bash
  --script=vuln

## ‚úÖ Outcome
Successfully enumerated hosts and open services on the target.
Gained practical experience with stealth scanning (Xmas scan) along with common TCP/UDP scans. 
Achieved discovering, utilizing, and creating NSE scripts.
Learned how to capture and document Nmap findings for vulnerability management workflows.
